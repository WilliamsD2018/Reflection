This past weekend we have had a better look on "def". Which has been a challenge for me to 
understand and use. The last homeworck assignment was about a dice roll, we had to create a 
game using functions. It was pretty hardat first, but the more you keep trying and understanding
what is going on, the easier it wil get. I am pretty happy that homeworcks are not due on Mondays anymore
because it was harder for me to complete them scince i am a 5-day student.

The past week we have worcked more on funtions. It is getting very hard as we go and I 
belive we are going to fast, sometimes I feel completly lost because I just don't understand
what I'm doing. I think we re going way too fst on each thing we are learning. But so far 
I dont think I'm doing so bad, but functions can get pretty long. I'm stuck in the homework.

could sepen on the assignments. I have learned more about whle statments and I am getting

This past week I have learned many new and different things. One of these things that we
saw in the past but used recently in our code was the use of a random number. This is 
something I feel is very important in coding because it adds many chalenges and is used
in many games. Also we continued with the if statments which are getting way more complicated
the more we get into them.

In the past week I have discoverd many things I can do with this program. I am more familiar
with my commands and I am learning much faster than I was at the start of the semester.
The main thing we learned to do was the ue if the if, else statments. I belive they are 
an important part on the develpoment of computers and I am looking forward to learn more.

This past week I have gone more into the comands we can use in python.
We have also learned to write complete commands to calculate a problem.
I will always wonder all the things I can do in Python and the things it can do with me.
To acctually be able to preform in the class it is necesary to practice outside the class.

This week I have learned some of the commands you can use in coding.
I feel there is just to much a person can learn about this subject, entering this class has made me anxious about what you can do with the commands there is. 
This week I’ve started to understand the principles of coding.
This week I’ve accomplished my first folders and files.
