# LAST REFLECTION

## 05/18/2018

This year has been a great one, I have learned many things in very different areas. Computer programing 1 has clearly been a challenge for me. And a reason for this is because of the amount of reserch and time you have to put into each topic, each problem, each code. All the study hours were I thought I was on the right track but insted I was completely lost.
I will remember this class for many years and each time someone asks me if they should take programing 1, I will tell them "It was certanly hard but it was worth it". I leave this class better than when I first came in and hopefully I do wellin my final.

## 5/11/2018

In the past weeks many things have happened in my programing abilities. The entire class has been challenged with many code problems that
we have done and resolved together. I belive these code wars have honed my coding skills. Mr. was gone for some time but we were sill able to maintain our 
level. I also had to resolve a coding problem similar to the past one. I had to create my own dice game with new rules. This was fairly easy because of the
time I spent working on it. Even though I was not able to complete it, I still got a lot out of it.

## 4/13/2018

This past weekend we have had a better look on "def," which has been a challenge for me to understand and utilize.
The last homework assignment was about a dice roll; we had to create a game using functions.
It was pretty hard at first, but the more you keep trying and understanding what is going on, the easier it will get.
I am pretty happy that homework is not due on Mondays anymore because it was harder for me to complete them since I am a 5-day student.

The past week we have worcked more on funtions. It is getting very hard as we go and I 
belive we are going to fast, sometimes I feel completly lost because I just don't understand
what I'm doing. I think we re going way too fst on each thing we are learning. But so far 
I dont think I'm doing so bad, but functions can get pretty long. I'm stuck in the homework.

In the pas week I have spent most of my time in Hwk6 whis is being a little hard for me,
it is difficult to do my homework because I am a 5-day which takes like 80% of the time I 
could sepen on the assignments. I have learned more about whle statments and I am getting 
more ideas for my google friday. I hope by the endo of the month I have something planned.

# Reflection 6

## 3/1/2018

This past week I have learned many new and different things. One of these things that we
saw in the past but used recently in our code was the use of a random number. This is 
something I feel is very important in coding because it adds many chalenges and is used
in many games. Also we continued with the if statments which are getting way more complicated
the more we get into them.

# Reflection 5

## 2/23/2018

In the past week I have discoverd many things I can do with this program. I am more familiar
with my commands and I am learning much faster than I was at the start of the semester.
The main thing we learned to do was the ue if the if, else statments. I belive they are 
an important part on the develpoment of computers and I am looking forward to learn more.

## 2/16/2018

In th last week ive worked hrd on many new things most of them i didnot understand copetly
but i think with practice and dedication i will be able to do all these easy.
What we looked at the most was the string format.
And today we worked on our project that we will be working on for the rest of the semester.

# Reclection 3

## 2/9/2018

This past week I have gone more into the comands we can use in python.
We have also learned to write complete commands to calculate a problem.
I will always wonder all the things I can do in Python and the things it can do with me.
To acctually be able to preform in the class it is necesary to practice outside the class.

# Reflection 2

## 2/2/2018

In the past week I've learned much about github and its commands.
I have made my self more familiar with coding and its principles.
I understand very little about Python but the more I practice it the simpler it gets.
I know how to use the simple folders and files commands whithout having to check .

# Reflection 1

## 01/26/20

This week I have learned some of the commands you can use in coding.
I feel there is just to much a person can learn about this subject, entering this class has made me anxious about what you can do with the commands there is. 
This week I’ve started to understand the principles of coding.
This week I’ve accomplished my first folders and files.
